# Pomsky playground

This is the React app with the interactive [Pomsky playground](https://playground.pomsky-lang.org).

## TODO

- Replace "Pomsky" label with "Editor Settings" in sidebar
- Proper Find & Replace functionality
- Locally save multiple files in localStorage, display as tabs
- Compile PCRE2 to wasm to run tests with PCRE2 on the web
- Don't highlight braces of text blocks
- Put error list somewhere else?
